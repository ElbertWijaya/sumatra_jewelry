# TODO: Fix Profile Screen Branch and Join Date Display

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated `backend/src/services/auth.service.ts` to include branchName, branchAddress, and joinedAt in login response
- [x] Updated `backend/src/routes/users.controller.ts` to include branchName, branchAddress, and joinedAt in /users/me endpoint

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Test the backend changes by running the server and checking API responses
- [ ] Verify frontend displays the new fields correctly
- [ ] Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality

## Notes
- Changes made to auth.service.ts and users.controller.ts to populate branchName, branchAddress, and joinedAt from database
- Frontend profile.tsx already references user.branchName, user.branchAddress, user.joinedAt
- Database schema has branch table with name and address columns, account table with created_at column
